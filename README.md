# YAPC: Yet Another Perplexity Clone
## >What is it?
its a very basic RAG question answerer right now, but it aims to eventually be what perplexity is

## >Why make it?
an inter iit problem statement was very similar to this, so i wanted a very quick demo to show i do know _some_ RAG.

## >How to use it?
download the llama 1b model from huggingface and put it in the models directory (this can be done with the dl.py script) or just change the pipeline to download it automatically.
After that put some data in the database folder and run `python mainloop.py`

## >It sucks
make it better. contribute code or fork it and do whatever you want
